# Getting Started

The first step if you haven't done so already is to install @angular/cli, run:

`npm install ‚Äêg @angular/cli`

from the VS Code terminal.

The next step is to create ourselves a new angular application. This can be done by running the following from the root of your project directory:

`ng new Angular-Electron-App`

You will see some along the lines of the image below:

Now browse to your app folder:

`cd Angular-Electron-App`
